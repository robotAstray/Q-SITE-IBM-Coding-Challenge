    "## Lab 1: First Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the IBM Quantum Hackathon at Q-SITE 2024!\n",
    "\n",
    "IBM has created a series of coding challenges for you to work through. Each of these \"labs\" centers on a different topic. The problems contained in each lab will progressively increase in difficulty. To complete these labs, you will need to know about coding in the Python language. Each lab will contain a mixture of tutorial content and pre-written code blocks, and challenge code blocks where you will need to fill in your own Qiskit code to solve the challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code required to complete the exercises should be typed under the line which has the `## WRITE YOUR CODE BELOW HERE ##` comment. Avoid making changes to any provided code as this could alter how other code in the notebook functions. You will submit answers to the grader methods that are called in this notebook. This lab has 3 graded exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can start working with Qiskit and these lab notebooks, you will need a computing environment in which to code and run the notebooks. You have a couple of options:\n",
    "- Install Qiskit and the Qiskit Runtime client locally on your computer along with Jupyter notebooks. See here for instructions: https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/install-qiskit\n",
    "- Use an online coding notebook environment (e.g. Colab, qBraid). You may need to install Qiskit from within notebook cells using the `!pip install qiskit qiskit_ibm_runtime` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need an account on the IBM Quantum Platform: https://quantum.ibm.com/ . Sign-up for free to run quantum circuits on real hardware available from our open-access quantum computers in the cloud. You'll be provided with up to 10 minutes per month of quantum runtime on the open access systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation for Qiskit can be found here: https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this first introductory lab, you will take your first steps on using Qiskit to compose quantum algorithms to solve problems. "

    "\n",
    "A good first circuit to construct is one that creates a Bell state. It demonstrates two quantum principles that are necessary for quantum computing: superposition and entanglement. You can find more information here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_state. Here is the circuit:\n",

    "\n",
    "For this exercise, build a circuit that prepares the 2-qubit Bell state $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle)$. The ```QuantumCircuit``` class in Qiskit is our starting point. To create a quantum circuit object, call the ```QuantumCircuit()``` with the number of qubits and number of classical bits to include. The following methods in ```QuantumCircuit``` will be helpful:\n",
    "- ```QuantumCircuit.h(qubit)```: adds a Hadamard (H) gate to the indicated qubit.\n",
    "- ```QuantumCircuit.cx(control, target)```: adds a Controlled NOT (CNOT or CX) gate with the given control qubit and target qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also need to measure the value of the qubits at the end of the circuit and store those measured values into the classical bits of the circuit. For this, use the ```QuantumCircuit.measure()``` method."

    "Given that this is a small circuit with only two qubits, we can run the circuit using a classical simulator. Qiskit 1.x provides simulators that run locally on your computer. These are implementations of the Primitives, basic programs in Qiskit that facilitate execution of your quantum circuits. There are two basic Primitives in Qiskit: 1) ```Sampler```, and 2) ```Estimator```. For now, let's focus on the ```Sampler```. This primitive can run a single circuit or a set of circuits, then return the results as a set of measured bitstrings. The ```Sampler``` will run your circuit multiple times, what is refered to as \"shots\". Because of the principles of quantum mechanics, we need to run the circuit multiple times to see all of the possible outcomes since any single circuit execution will only give one possible outcome.\n",

This introduced a new execution interface and new format for returning results from a set of executions. Circuits must be encapsulated within a ***Primitive Unified Block (PUB)***, basically a Python tuple containing the circuit and any parameters that go along with them. The ```run()``` function of the primitive then takes in an array of PUBs and executes each one. Results from execution are returned as a list containing one element for each PUB that was submitted.\n",
